# Weather Widget v2

This project displays Bitcoin price data alongside weather and time
information.  To run it continuously on a low-power device like an Intel
Atom with 2&nbsp;GB of RAM, simply open `index.html` in a modern browser.
All data fetch intervals remain unchanged but the page has been tuned to
use fewer timers so it can operate as a 24/7 dashboard with minimal
resource usage.
